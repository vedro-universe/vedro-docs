## General Information

### What does "Vedro" mean?

**Pronunciation:** vedro (_veh-dro_) — stress on the first syllable. Think of "veh" (like the vowel sound in "bed"), then "dro" (like the start of "drone").

**Meaning & Concept:** In Croatian and Serbian (Serbo-Croatian), vedro generally means "clear", "bright", or "cheerful". It’s often used to describe a clear, cloudless sky or fair weather. By choosing this word, the framework aims to convey transparency and stability in testing. Just as a clear sky has no obscurities, the goal of Vedro is to eliminate confusion or uncertainty in the testing process, providing an open and direct approach to ensuring quality.

### Is there a big company behind Vedro?

No. Vedro has been open source from day one and isn’t affiliated with any company. It’s a community-driven project guided by passionate contributors and maintainers who believe in clear, reliable, and easy-to-understand testing practices.
